# Image Classification from Scratch

This repository provides an image classification implementation from scratch, without relying on pre-trained models or external libraries. The goal is to understand the underlying concepts and mechanics of image classification algorithms. This README file will guide you through the project setup and usage.

## Installation

To use this image classification implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-from-scratch.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd image-classification-from-scratch
```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The main script for image classification is `classify.py`. To classify an image, follow these steps:

1. Place the image you want to classify in the `images` directory.

2. Open the `classify.py` file and modify the `image_path` variable to specify the path to your image file.

3. Run the script:

```shell
python classify.py
```

The script will load the image, preprocess it, and classify it using the implemented algorithm. The predicted class label will be displayed in the console.

## Algorithm Details

The image classification algorithm implemented in this project follows a simple pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The input image is loaded and preprocessed to ensure it has consistent dimensions and a standardized format.

2. **Feature Extraction**: A set of features is extracted from the preprocessed image. This can include various techniques such as edge detection, color histograms, or gradient-based features.

3. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained using the extracted features. In this implementation, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used, but you can experiment with other classifiers as well.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using a validation set to assess its performance and fine-tune its parameters if necessary.

5. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new images. The algorithm takes an input image, preprocesses it, extracts the features, and feeds them into the trained model for prediction.
